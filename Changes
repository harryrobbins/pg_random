Revision history for PostgreSQL extension pair.

0.1.1
      - Fixed metadata file to list "pair" as the extension, not "pgtap".
      - Added Changes file.
      - Eliminated a line in the `Makefile` with "pgtap" in it. D'oh!
      - Added `COMMIT` to the end of `sql/pair.sql`. Might help with
        installation.

0.1.0 2010-10-18T20:59:54Z
      - Initial version.

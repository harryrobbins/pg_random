Revision history for PostgreSQL extension pair.

0.1.2 2011-04-20T23:43:33
      - Properly updated version number in all relevant files.
      - Added abstract and doc file to the `provides` section of `META.json`.
      - Changed doc extension to `.md` so that it will be parsed as Markdown
        by PGXN.
      - Added PostgreSQL 9.1 `CREATE EXTENSION` support, including migration
        from an unpackaged install via `CREATE EXTENSION pair FROM
        unpackaged`.

0.1.1 2010-10-29T22:42:05
      - Fixed metadata file to list "pair" as the extension, not "pgtap".
      - Added Changes file.
      - Eliminated a line in the `Makefile` with "pgtap" in it. D'oh!
      - Added `COMMIT` to the end of `sql/pair.sql`. Might help with
        installation.
      - Using more `wildcard` more in the `Makefile` so that we don't have to
        maintain it manually when files are added or removed.

0.1.0 2010-10-18T20:59:54Z
      - Initial version.
